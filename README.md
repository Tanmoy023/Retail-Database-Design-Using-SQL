# 🛒 Retail-Database-Design-Using-SQL

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a fully normalized **Retail Analytics Database** using **MySQL**. It simulates a real-world retail system with customers, products, categories, orders, and transactional sales data, enabling advanced SQL-based business analytics.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a scalable and normalized relational database.
- Implement real-world transactional data models.
- Perform advanced SQL queries for business insights.
- Practice complex joins, subqueries, aggregations, and analytical queries.
- Build an industry-relevant SQL portfolio project.

## 🗂️ Database Schema
The database consists of the following core tables:

- **customers** – Stores customer details.
- **categories** – Stores product categories.
- **products** – Stores product information.
- **orders** – Stores order transactions.
- **order_items** – Stores detailed product-level sales records.

## 🔗 Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The database schema follows a normalized relational design with clear relationships between:

- Customers → Orders  
- Orders → Order Items  
- Products → Categories

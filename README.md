# 🛒 Retail-Database-Design-Using-SQL

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Retail-Database-Design-Using-SQL** is an end-to-end SQL project designed to simulate real-world retail operations and demonstrate industry-level database design and data analysis using **MySQL**.  
The project focuses on building a normalized relational database, inserting large-scale transactional data, and extracting meaningful business insights through advanced SQL queries.

This project highlights strong fundamentals in **RDBMS concepts**, **SQL analytics**, and **database optimization**, making it suitable for Data Analyst and SQL Developer roles.

---

## 🧱 Database Design
The database consists of **5 core tables**, designed with proper normalization and relationships:

- **customers** – Stores customer demographic information  
- **categories** – Defines product categories  
- **products** – Maintains product details and inventory  
- **orders** – Captures order-level information  
- **order_items** – Stores transactional order details  

Primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints are used to ensure **data integrity and consistency**.

An **EER (Enhanced Entity-Relationship) Diagram** was generated using **MySQL Workbench** to visualize the schema and table relationships.

## 🛠️ SQL Concepts & Features Used
This project covers all major SQL concepts required in industry:

- Database & table creation (DDL)
- Data insertion with large realistic datasets
- Primary Key, Foreign Key, and constraints
- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and set-based logic
- Aggregations (`SUM`, `GROUP BY`)
- Window functions (`RANK`)
- Views for reusable analytics
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Stored Procedures for parameterized queries
- Triggers for automated stock updates
- Transactions (`COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK`)
- Schema visualization using EER diagrams

---

## 📊 Business Analytics Performed
- Customer-wise total sales and spending rank
- Best-selling products and top categories
- Unsold and low-performing products
- Order status distribution (Delivered, Cancelled, Returned)
- Category-wise revenue contribution
- Inventory impact through automated triggers

---

## 🧪 Sample Use Cases
- Identify top customers based on revenue
- Analyze product demand and stock movement
- Optimize queries using indexes
- Reuse business logic via views and procedures
- Visualize database relationships using EER diagrams

---

## 🖥️ Tools & Technologies
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **IDE:** MySQL Workbench  
- **Concepts:** SQL, RDBMS, Data Analytics
